      <description>Dreaming big or achievable # From: ðŸŒŠ Project Oyster
My friend says big goals kill his productivity because reaching them is too unrealistic, though I find them motivating. An insane plan (like crossing the Atlantic Ocean on my yacht) gives purpose to my efforts, and I like imagining the day I reach it. In the end, it&amp;rsquo;s a personal preference that varies from person to person.
That&amp;rsquo;s what I thought.</description>

      <description>Dreams vs goals # From: ðŸŒŠ Project Oyster
When I moved to the USA, I decided to make my dreams become a reality, but I have failed to take any significant steps so far. This problem has haunted me for years: I have ideas, but they never become more than a dream.
I analysed why this is the case, and while doing so, I remembered a simple phrase: is it a dream or a goal?</description>
