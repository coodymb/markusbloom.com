      <description>I write too many words # In school, I learned that writing is about the number of pages. In university, I got introduced to the word count; my papers had to be between 3,000 and 3,500 words, my Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s dissertation at least 9,000 words, and to finish my Master&amp;rsquo;s degree, I had to write 20,000 words. In Ulysses, the text editor I use today, the word count is just one click away, and I can set daily goals.</description>
