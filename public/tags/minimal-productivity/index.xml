      <description>Doing &amp;gt; thinking # I mastered the art of founding companies in my head. I have ideas, come up with features, see the potential for expansions, and envision a future in which the company has thousands of employees, all before working a single minute. This process can go on for days, and some unrealised ideas spook around my head for years.
While I have an above-average backlog of ideas in my optimised Obsidian setup that is part of my perfect productivity environment, I fail to show any output.</description>
