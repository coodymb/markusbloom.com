      <description>Dreaming big or achievable # From: ðŸŒŠ Project Oyster
My friend says big goals kill his productivity because reaching them is too unrealistic, though I find them motivating. An insane plan (like crossing the Atlantic Ocean on my yacht) gives purpose to my efforts, and I like imagining the day I reach it. In the end, it&amp;rsquo;s a personal preference that varies from person to person.
That&amp;rsquo;s what I thought.</description>

      <description>Dreams vs goals # From: ðŸŒŠ Project Oyster
When I moved to the USA, I decided to make my dreams become a reality, but I have failed to take any significant steps so far. This problem has haunted me for years: I have ideas, but they never become more than a dream.
I analysed why this is the case, and while doing so, I remembered a simple phrase: is it a dream or a goal?</description>

      <description>Focus # The art of not pursuing projects - how doing less results in more.
My goals are far away, and I worry whether I&amp;rsquo;ll ever reach them. This blog should document the path towards my dreams, yet I fail to take any steps. I have ideas, start projects, and then they all fade into nothing.
The reason: my lack of focus.
My biggest weakness is getting excited about new ideas before giving the ones I started the chance to grow.</description>

      <title>I write too many words</title>

      <description>I write too many words # In school, I learned that writing is about the number of pages. In university, I got introduced to the word count; my papers had to be between 3,000 and 3,500 words, my Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s dissertation at least 9,000 words, and to finish my Master&amp;rsquo;s degree, I had to write 20,000 words. In Ulysses, the text editor I use today, the word count is just one click away, and I can set daily goals.</description>
