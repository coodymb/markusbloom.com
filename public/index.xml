      <description>Project Oyster üåä # The journey of my life
Goal: Sailing over the Atlantic Ocean. My favourite place, a small German island, is 6,796.14 km away from the town I live in. After moving to the USA, I wanted to turn my dreams into reality, founding businesses that let me travel back home and work from anywhere in the world.
So far, I have failed.
The fact that ideas stay in my head, never turning into more than a dream, haunts me, and I worry about my time running out.</description>

      <description>Opas Putter # ‚õ≥Ô∏è The story of a little company selling golf putter - running a startup on 4 hours/week.
Idea # Putters haven&amp;rsquo;t changed much since 1966 //(link), when //___ came up with the perfect design. It&amp;rsquo;s a block of iron that&amp;rsquo;s carved// into a siple shape. That&amp;rsquo;s it. Golf is a difficult sport, and I believe that changing equipment, in particular the putter, isn&amp;rsquo;t improving my game. On the contrary, changing gear might keep me from real progress.</description>

      <description>Dreaming big or achievable # From: üåä Project Oyster
My friend says big goals kill his productivity because reaching them is too unrealistic, though I find them motivating. An insane plan (like crossing the Atlantic Ocean on my yacht) gives purpose to my efforts, and I like imagining the day I reach it. In the end, it&amp;rsquo;s a personal preference that varies from person to person.
That&amp;rsquo;s what I thought.</description>

      <description>Dreams vs goals # From: üåä Project Oyster
When I moved to the USA, I decided to make my dreams become a reality, but I have failed to take any significant steps so far. This problem has haunted me for years: I have ideas, but they never become more than a dream.
I analysed why this is the case, and while doing so, I remembered a simple phrase: is it a dream or a goal?</description>

      <description>Focus # The art of not pursuing projects - how doing less results in more.
My goals are far away, and I worry whether I&amp;rsquo;ll ever reach them. This blog should document the path towards my dreams, yet I fail to take any steps. I have ideas, start projects, and then they all fade into nothing.
The reason: my lack of focus.
My biggest weakness is getting excited about new ideas before giving the ones I started the chance to grow.</description>

      <description>I write too many words # In school, I learned that writing is about the number of pages. In university, I got introduced to the word count; my papers had to be between 3,000 and 3,500 words, my Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s dissertation at least 9,000 words, and to finish my Master&amp;rsquo;s degree, I had to write 20,000 words. In Ulysses, the text editor I use today, the word count is just one click away, and I can set daily goals.</description>
