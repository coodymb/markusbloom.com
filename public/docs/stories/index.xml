      <description>Project Oyster üåä # The journey of my life
Goal: Sailing over the Atlantic Ocean. My favourite place, a small German island, is 6,796.14 km away from the town I live in. After moving to the USA, I wanted to turn my dreams into reality, founding businesses that let me travel back home and work from anywhere in the world.
So far, I have failed.
The fact that ideas stay in my head, never turning into more than a dream, haunts me, and I worry about my time running out.</description>

      <description>Opas Putter # ‚õ≥Ô∏è The story of a little company selling golf putter - running a startup on 4 hours/week.
Idea # Putters haven&amp;rsquo;t changed much since 1966 //(link), when //___ came up with the perfect design. It&amp;rsquo;s a block of iron that&amp;rsquo;s carved// into a siple shape. That&amp;rsquo;s it. Golf is a difficult sport, and I believe that changing equipment, in particular the putter, isn&amp;rsquo;t improving my game. On the contrary, changing gear might keep me from real progress.</description>

To get things rolling, I decided on 30 goals I&amp;rsquo;ll reach in the next two years:</description>
