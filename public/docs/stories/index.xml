      <description>Project Oyster üåä # The journey of my life
Goal: Sailing over the Atlantic Ocean. My favourite place, a small German island, is 6,796.14 km away from the town I live in. After moving to the USA, I wanted to turn my dreams into reality, founding businesses that let me travel back home and work from anywhere in the world.
So far, I have failed.
The fact that ideas stay in my head, never turning into more than a dream, haunts me, and I worry about my time running out.</description>

      <description>Opas Putter # ‚õ≥Ô∏è starting a company selling golf putters with 4 hours/week.
The first step of Project Oyster üåä ‚úé How I decided on this idea Idea # Putters have been the same since 1966 when Karsten Solheim created the perfect design. It&amp;rsquo;s a block of iron that&amp;rsquo;s milled into a simple shape - that&amp;rsquo;s it. Golf is difficult, though I believe changing equipment, particularly the putter, isn&amp;rsquo;t improving my game.</description>

To get things rolling, I decided on 30 goals I&amp;rsquo;ll reach in the next two years:</description>
