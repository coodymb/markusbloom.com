# Project Oyster 🌊

*The journey of my life*

My favourite place in the world is a small German island, which is currently 6,796.14 km away. When I moved to the USA, I decided to make my dreams become a reality, but I have failed to take any significant steps so far. It is a problem haunting me for years: I have ideas with great potential (*at least, I think so*), but they never become more than a dream.

I tried to analyse why this is the case, and while doing so, I remembered a simple phrase I once heard. Sadly, I forgot the source, but it goes something like this: “is it a dream or a goal? “.

## The Dream

> I will set sail with my Oyster 595 in my wife’s hometown in the USA to cross the Atlantic Ocean all the way to this small island, where I will set anchor and enjoy a glass of Bourbon I brought from Kentucky with a chaser of Jever I bought on the island. I can do that because I achieved the financial freedom to work on my projects from wherever I am in the world.

I like to give my goals a name, and this big project, which sets the framework for all other projects, will be called **🌊 Project Oyster** ( *I’ve always been in love with [Oyster Yachts](https://oysteryachts.com/?ref=markusbloom.com)*).

Sounds ambitious (*and narcissistic*), doesn’t it?

I am 28 now and have not only the opportunity to dream big but also the time to make these dreams become a reality. However, that also means right now is the time to put all my efforts into them; otherwise, I will wake up one day and realise that my time has run out (the big fear of my life).
