# Project Oyster 🌊

*The journey of my life*


Crossing the Atlantic Ocean on my Oyster Yacht and sailing back 6,796.14 km to the country I grew up in is my big dream. Reaching it means I achieved the freedom, time, and financial independence to embark on adventures like this to fill my life with stories. Right now, I'm still far away from that freedom.

Project Oyster is a random collection of thoughts, experiences, and milestones in my probably endless efforts toward this goal and away from my big fear of my dreams and ideas staying in my head until it is too late to make them real.

> Somebody will reach this dream - why shouldn't that be me?
