# Opas Putter

⛳️ The story of a little company selling golf putter - running a startup on 4 hours/week.

## Idea

Putters haven't changed much since 1966 //(link), when //___ came up with the perfect design. It's a block of iron that's carved// into a siple shape. That's it. Golf is a difficult sport, and I believe that changing equipment, in particular the putter, isn't improving my game. On the contrary, changing gear might keep me from real progress. // link zu lernkurven

Opas Putter will be the club I want to have in my bag. A tool that looks great, is the highest possible quality, and let's me focus on my skill.

**It's a buy it once and keep it forever product.**

**April 2023 - Is it this simple?:**  

 Create CAD for a classic putter + on demand mill = a perfect [BIFL](https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/) product

## Defining success

First startup of the business portfolio I am trying to build up.

First Company running on striaght lines, build completely with flow atoms

Always difficult, because it's impossible to forecast 

The real goal should be learnings, though something to work towards might be nice



### Goal

Selling one putter a day.

Assuming I want to hold this rate through the next 20 years, I have to sell 7300 clubs. Considering the 25m people playing golf in the US alone, this is a market share of 

There are 25m golfers in the US. Going for the very conservative assumption that everyone needs a new putter around every 20 years

(Wnating to run this company for around 25 years would mean 9120 sold putters, which is a market share of about 0.04% ... ngl, that seems kinda possible.)

Ngl, this seems achievable.

### Milestones

1. Launch perfect product
2. 1st sale
3. Sell 10/month
4. Establish own production
5. 

## DNA

*Business plan light*

// Datum

// Concept & Theme noch einbringen



// Nicht zu viel - ich kann meine eigene Welt aufbauen aber es wäre gut, wenn man hier ein paar Tichtlinien folgt

First, I'll define this company's ⧆ DNA // Ist das eine Story oder ein Subflow?

While I believe a full business plan to be vaste of time at this point, I deem it important to define a few parameters that'll guide me towards my goal.



Starting and testing the idea in the real world is more important thatn planning it to perfection, tho



I should know the general direction

Is the design patented, why do other companies have the same design wthout any problems
