# Opas Putter

‚õ≥Ô∏è starting a company selling golf putters with 4 hours/week.

- *The first step of [Project Oyster üåä](/docs/stories/project-oyster.md)*
- ‚úé [How I decided on this idea](putter-vs-habit-tracker)

## Idea

Putters have been the same since [1966](https://ping.com/en-us/media/articles/evergreen/anser-putter-technology-triumphs) when Karsten Solheim created the perfect design. It's a block of iron that's milled into a simple shape - that's it. Golf is difficult, though I believe changing equipment, particularly the putter, isn't improving my game. On the contrary, it might keep me from real progress.

Opas Putter will be the club I want in my bag  - a tool of the highest possible quality that looks great and lets me focus on my skill.

**It's a product to buy once and keep forever.**

**April 2023 - How I imagine it:**  

 Create CAD for a classic putter + contract a mill = a perfect [BIFL](https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/) product

*(do I underestimate this?)*
