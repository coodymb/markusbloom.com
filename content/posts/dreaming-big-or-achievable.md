# Dreaming big or achievable

*From: [ðŸŒŠ Project Oyster](/docs/stories/project-oyster.md)*

My friend says big goals kill his productivity because reaching them is too unrealistic, though I find them motivating. An insane plan (like crossing the Atlantic Ocean on my yacht) gives purpose to my efforts, and I like imagining the day I reach it. In the end, it's a personal preference that varies from person to person.

That's what I thought.

But there is an important difference between my friend and me: he reaches his achievable goals while I fail to take a single step.

Maybe he's right because while a big goal motivates me, it is vague, and I have no idea where to start. I jump between projects but never give any of them a chance to grow. While he takes small steps every day, I start over or work on things that don't bring me forward - should I start dreaming achievable as well?

The secret, I now suspect, might be the combination of big goals with achievable, well-defined steps along the way. My dream becomes reachable through well-defined and achievable milestones.
